# Mycobiome Project Boilerplates Repository

*Author: Lucy Goodyear*

This repository contains all relevant boilerplate scripts for my analysis.

## Requirements

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux. MacTeX or equivalent is required for LaTeX related files.

## Scripts

All folders contain the following scripts:

dada2_hpc_pipeline.R

This is a script following the dada2 IS2 tutorial with some modifications to use only the forward reads and to run on HPC.
