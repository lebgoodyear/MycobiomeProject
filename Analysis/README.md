# Mycobiome Project Analysis Repository

*Author: Lucy Goodyear*  
*Created: 04/02/20*

This repository contains all relevant scripts and data for my analysis. There are 3 subdirectories:

**Boilerplates** contains all my boilerplate script for running various filtering/analysis steps.

**Countries_runs** contains all my data divided by countries/run.

**UNITE_database** contains the database downloaded from UNITE that my data is BLASTed against.

## Requirements

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux. MacTeX or equivalent is required for LaTeX related files.
