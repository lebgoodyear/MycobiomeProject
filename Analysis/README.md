# Mycobiome Project Analysis Repository

*Author: Lucy Goodyear*

This directory contains one subdirectory that contains all relevant scripts for my analysis.

Locally I have 4 other directories at this level: ```Original_Data```, ```Runs_Countries```, ```Results``` and ```UNITE_database```.

## Requirements

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux. MacTeX or equivalent is required for LaTeX related files.
